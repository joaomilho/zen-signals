/*
 * `takeBetween` gets the current value in a process and pass it
 * if and only if it was emitted between two consecutive values
 * of another process, which acts like a switch
 *
 * Its usage is similar to `merge`:
 *
 * ```
 * const source = takeBetween(sourceA, sourceB)
 * const subscriber = process(source)
 * ```
 *
 * ```
 * takeBetween(sourceA, sourceB)
 * ```
 * sourceA --x--x----x----x-
 * sourceB o--o---o---o-o--o
 * emits   ---o-------o-o---
 *
